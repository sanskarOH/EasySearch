# Smart Search Tool

**An intelligent React Native app that cuts through the noise of web searching**

Tired of wading through ads, clickbait, and irrelevant results when searching for specific content? This app generates optimized search queries (Google dorks) and opens them directly in your browser for precise, efficient results.

## 🎯 What it does

Simply enter what you're looking for and select the content type:
- **Music** - Songs, albums, artists
- **Movies** - Films, trailers, reviews  
- **Games** - PC games, mobile games, reviews
- **Books** - eBooks, PDFs, audiobooks
- **Videos** - Tutorials, documentaries, entertainment
- **Apps** - Software, mobile applications

The app automatically generates multiple targeted search queries and opens them in Chrome for immediate, relevant results - no more scrolling through spam!
